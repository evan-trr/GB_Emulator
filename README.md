# GB_Emulator

an Emulator for the Gameboy consol in Rust.
I am new to Rust and to the GameBoy, I am only a student in IT in second year, so this project is just for fun.
I don't know if I will be able to have a full emulator working but I guess it will depend on the time i have to work on it.

As I said i am only a student and I am new to Rust so forgive me if i do a lot of mistake.
